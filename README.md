# crazy-cards-app
 An app that allows customers to enter their details and review credit cards that are applicable to their credit status.

## Capabilities

The FE app allows you to: 

1. Fill in a form, stating personal income and employment details.
2. View available card results.
3. Select individual card results and see total credit limit of selected cards.
4. View the details of an individual card.
5. Navigate back whilst maintaining app state.

### Bonus Features
1. A conigured local server
2. An endpoint that returns mocked card details (not using db).
3. Endpoint testing

### What is missing
1. FE unit testing using jest (this would have been added if I had more time).
2. Nice styling.
3. A react router.

### What would I do if I had more time
1. Add more jest tests and unit test in the FE
2. Structure html more better and implement nicer styling
3. Add a database instead of having a mocked data.

### Challenges
1. Setting up React using typescript.
2. CSS 

### What did I learn/improve?
1. Setting up the FE app, hadn't done this in a while
2. Configuring libraries like Jest/TypeScript/React
3. Configuring Select components from scratch.
